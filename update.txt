How to update FUMP (Follow Up Mailing List Processor) to v5.1. 

Update Instructions:

STEP 1
Backup the following files and directories:
 - ‘cnf.rd’ - file with your database connection settings
 - ‘cron’ directory with ‘startercron’ file
 - ‘personal’ directory with your saved signatures and custom pages
 - *.html files in your ‘shabl’ directory (if you already changed some HTML templates like ‘regerror.html’ or ‘linknotfound.html’)
 - ‘backup’ directory (Database backups are stored here)

STEP 2
Delete all the files from following directories:
 - ‘shabl’ (except your modified *.html files)
 - ‘lib’ (Delete this directory)
 - all files from FUMP root directory (EXCEPT ‘cnf.rd’ files) 

STEP 3
Upload the files from the FUMP archive package: ‘shabl’, ‘lib’ and all files (except ‘cnf.rd’) from FUMP root directory. You need to upload all files in FTP TEXT mode (except files in shabl/img/ - these file must be uploaded in BINARY mode).

STEP 4
Change permissions for all *.cgi and 'broadcaster' and 'sender' files  to '755' (please sure that all *.cgi files has permission 755 and was uploaded in FTP TEXT mode if you received 500 error in your browser). Change permissions to '666' to 'broadcast.log'.

STEP 5
Upload any saved files from ‘Step 1’. 
NOTE: If you are updating from 4.20, the 'templates' directory was changed to 'personal/signatures'. You need to manually move your TXT files from 'templates' to 'personal/signatures'.

STEP 6
Run the updater (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/fump/update.cgi).

STEP 7
Click 'Finish' button to complete the database upgrade.

STEP 8
Once you have completed the installation, you need to delete the install.cgi and update.cgi from your server. Leaving them is a serious potential security issue! A notice will be present in the admin interface as long as these files are still present.
